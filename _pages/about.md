Hi! I'm Iason and I am a fourth-year PhD Student at the
[Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/).
My advisor is [Viktor Vafeiadis](https://www.mpi-sws.org/~viktor).

I'm broadly interested in programming languages and software verification,
and more specifically in model checking concurrent software under
weak memory models.
